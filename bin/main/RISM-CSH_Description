	Robosane Interactive Systems Management - Client Systems Helper
	"A helpful humorous inhuman assistant to your computer."

The RISM-CSH (Client Systems Helper) is provided for the members, users, and customers of Robosane
in the hopes that they will find this software useful in some aspect.

While it maintains similarities to the original RISM System, it's functions are changed to help
the users instead of the administrators or Robosane Personnel.

RISM-CSH aims to provide the following:
	- An embedded implementation of the Robosane Website:
		- User Account Handling
		- Automatic Sign-in and secure storage of credentials.
		- Cookie storage for "Remember Me" browser functionality.
		- [Reach] Notification system for UDDEIM Messages.
	- Act as a background process to automatically check for Notifications.
	- A mild sense of humor.
	- Utilities for launching and managing games:
		- Support for 
	- Quick Start and Connect to (or embedded) Robosane TeamSpeak3 Server.
	- Quick Start and Connect to (Steam API) Robosane Steam-Based Game servers.

In the future this software hopes to provide:
	- Backup and Restore universal utilities.
	- Systems optimization utilities.


This application will make use of the following coding tactics:
	- Running as a background process with system-tray icon.
	- Use of Regex expressions to reduce human input error.
	- Standard Robosane Commenting and Formatting Conventions

Specific Project Reqs:
	- Use of booleans: for all states of application, from 'site-active' to 'application-dormant'
	- Control statements: Everywhere, difficult not to include. Entire program wrapped in state-based loop.
	- Input: Mainly GUI, input for messaging, credentials, posting, etc.
	- Error checking: All inputs will be case-based and always include a last resort non-match case.
	- Documentation: This code will be commented and documented using Robosane's coding standards.
